# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Sorting Algorithms**, fundamental techniques in computer science for organizing data. It covers various sorting methods, including comparison-based and non-comparison-based algorithms, along with their time complexities, use cases, and optimizations. Topics include bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, and more.

## Resources

- You can learn more about elementary Sorting Algorithms from this [slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/elementary-sorting-algorithms/fullscreen) and more about intermediate Sorting Algorithms from this [slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/intermediate-sorting-algorithms/fullscreen)

- You can also track time complexity for each algorithm from [Big O Complexity Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) and how the sorting works for all the algorithms using this [tool](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).

- You can also track how each algorithm sort elements using [visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting).
