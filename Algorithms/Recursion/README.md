# Recursion

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Recursion**, a key problem-solving technique in algorithm design. It demonstrates how complex problems can be broken into smaller subproblems using self-referential functions. Topics include base cases, recursive patterns, and optimization strategies.

## Resources

- You can learn more about Recursion from the [slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/searching-algorithms-22/fullscreen).
