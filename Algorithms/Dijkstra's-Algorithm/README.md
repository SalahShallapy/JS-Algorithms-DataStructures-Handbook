# Dijkstra's Algorithm

This folder contains a detailed overview and implementation examples of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, a fundamental algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It explains the core idea of using a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently select the next closest node, and walks through each step of the algorithm with clear code samples and visualizations. Use cases include GPS navigation, network routing, game AI pathfinding, and traffic optimization. Comparisons with other shortest path algorithms like Bellman-Ford and optimizations using binary heaps or Fibonacci heaps are also covered.
