# Graphs

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Graphs**, a versatile data structure used to model relationships between objects. It covers essential concepts such as vertices (nodes), edges, adjacency lists/matrices, and whether graphs are directed, undirected, weighted, or unweighted. Key operations and algorithms are explored, including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford, topological sorting, and minimum spanning trees (Prim’s and Kruskal’s). Real-world applications like social networks, routing algorithms, dependency resolution, and recommendation systems are also discussed.
