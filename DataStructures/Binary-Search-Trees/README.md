# Binary Search Trees

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. It covers key concepts, operations, and use cases, including insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching. Additionally, it explores tree balancing, optimizations, and real-world applications of binary search trees in areas like databases, file systems, and memory-efficient searching.
