# Binary Heaps

This folder contains examples and explanations of **Binary Heaps**, an essential tree-based data structure used in many algorithmic applications. It covers key concepts and operations such as insertion, deletion, heapify, and peek (get min/max). Both Min-Heaps and Max-Heaps are explored, with visual examples and code implementations. The material also discusses practical use cases like priority queues.
